* Threepenny-gui Flexbox
  Flexbox layouts for Threepenny-gui.

  This library was written following the wonderful
  [[https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox][A Complete Guide to
  Flexbox]] and using the wonderful
  [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clay][Clay]] library as a CSS DSL.

* Usage
  This library exposes the entire Flexbox API.

  We collect the Flexbox properties that apply to the parent element, things
  like ~flex-direction~, in a ~ParentProps~ data type.

  We collect the Flexbox properties that apply to the children elements, things
  like ~flex-grow~, in a ~ChildProps~ data type.

  You can set a property by using the defaults and over-riding a speicific entry
  using record syntax:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
  defaultChildProps { cFlexGrow = 2 }
  #+END_SRC
  
  What you'll propbably use a lot is `flexbox`, which you provide with a parent
  element and properties, and a list of children elements and their respective
  properties.

  The example image above was produced with the below code. It attaches three
  ~div~ s with text "foo" to the ~body~ in the ratio 1:2:1. The example can be
  run with ~stack exec threepenny-flexbox-exe~.
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC Haskell
  -- |Example of three divs using a flex-grow ratio of 1:2:1.
  example :: Window -> UI ()
  example w = void $
    flexbox (getBody w) defaultParentProps $ [grow 1, grow 2, grow 1]

  -- |Example "foo" div and given flex-grow value.
  grow :: Int -> (UI Element, ChildProps)
  grow n = (foo, defaultChildProps { cFlexGrow = n })
    where foo = UI.div # set UI.text "foo"
                       # set UI.style [("background-color", "#F89406"),
                                       ("margin", "8px")]
  #+END_SRC
